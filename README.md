# Machine-Learning-Process
This repository is the process of all the tools and technologies I've covered in my Machine Learning journey.

1. Starting right from the programming fundamentals like data types in Python and OOPs concepts which covers :-
   1. Classes and Objects
   2. Methods and Constructors
   3. Inheritance and its types
   4. Encapsulation
   5. Polymorphism
  
2. After learning the fundamentals, further proceeded with Python libraries used for Data Acqusition like Numpy and Pandas are learned. Here I learned about importing the data from various sources like .CSV files, SQL data and from APIs right into our workplace i.e jupyter notebook/ Colab.

3. After learning about acquiring the data, now it's time to learn to learn about visualizing that data with Data Visualization libraries in Python, like Matplotlib and Seaborn. Here we learn about different types of visualization techniques using different ways of plots like   :-
   1. Heatmap
   2. Scatterplot
   3. boxplot
   4. Lineplot
   5. Violenplot
   6. Pairplot
    etc.

4. After Visualization I went on to study statistics, its types and types of data in depth, as it is one of most important and core topics in ML. Since most ofthe parts are studied in notebook and theory, here only a few topics are shown. The theory part which is not shown here covers topics like Descriptive stats, Inferential stats, Cumelative Frequency, Covarience, Percentile, Quantile, Inter Quantile Range (IQR), Distrbution techniques, Z-test, T-test, Z-score, p-value, Hypothesis testing, Standardization, Normalization and much more ...

5. After Statistics, I started the Data Analysis and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), using whatever learned so far and performed EDA on some datasets. An example is also included. Data Analysis is done in five broad steps :-
   1. Asking the right questions from the data.
   2. Data Preprocessing.
   3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
   4. Drawing conclusions.
   5. Commiting Results.
