    "Supervised learning, also known as supervised machine learning, is a subcategory of machine learning and artificial intelligence. It is defined by its use of labeled datasets to train algorithms that to classify data or predict outcomes accurately.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Unsupervised Learning?\n",
    "What is unsupervised learning? Unsupervised learning, also known as unsupervised machine learning, uses machine learning algorithms to analyze and cluster unlabeled datasets. These algorithms discover hidden patterns or data groupings without the need for human intervention.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Reniforcement Learning?\n",
    "Reinforcement Learning is a part of machine learning. Here, agents are self-trained on reward and punishment mechanisms. It's about taking the best possible action or path to gain maximum rewards and minimum punishment through observations in a specific situation.\n"

    "### 1. Poor Quality of Data\n",
    "Data plays a significant role in the machine learning process. One of the significant issues that machine learning professionals face is the absence of good quality data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Underfitting of Training Data\n",
    "This process occurs when data is unable to establish an accurate relationship between input and output variables. It simply means trying to fit in undersized jeans. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Overfitting of Training Data\n",
    "Overfitting refers to a machine learning model trained with a massive amount of data that negatively affect its performance. It is like trying to fit in Oversized jeans.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Machine Learning is a Complex Process\n",
    "The machine learning industry is young and is continuously changing. Rapid hit and trial experiments are being carried on. The process is transforming, and hence there are high chances of error which makes the learning complex. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Lack of Training Data\n",
    "The most important task you need to do in the machine learning process is to train the data to achieve an accurate output. Less amount training data will produce inaccurate or too biased predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Slow Implementation\n",
    "This is one of the common issues faced by machine learning professionals. The machine learning models are highly efficient in providing accurate results, but it takes a tremendous amount of time. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Imperfections in the Algorithm When Data Grows\n",
    "So you have found quality data, trained it amazingly, and the predictions are really concise and accurate. Yay, you have learned how to create a machine learning algorithm!!  But wait, there is a twist; the model may become useless in the future as data grows."

    "Image Recognition is one of the reasons behind the boom one could have experienced in the field of Deep Learning. The task which started from classification between cats and dog images has now evolved up to the level of Face Recognition and real-world use cases based on that like employee attendance tracking.\n",

    "### 2. Speech Recognition\n",
    "Speech Recognition based smart systems like Alexa and Siri have certainly come across and used to communicate with them. In the backend, these systems are based basically on Speech Recognition systems. These systems are designed such that they can convert voice instructions into text.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Recommender Systems\n",
    "As our world has digitalized more and more approximately every tech giants try to provide customized services to its users. This application is possible just because of the recommender systems which can analyze a user’s preferences and search history and based on that they can recommend content or services to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Fraud Detection\n",
    "In today’s world, most things have been digitalized varying from buying toothbrushes or making transactions of millions of dollars everything is accessible and easy to use. But with this process of digitization cases of fraudulent transactions and fraudulent activities have increased. Identifying them is not that easy but machine learning systems are very efficient in these tasks. "
